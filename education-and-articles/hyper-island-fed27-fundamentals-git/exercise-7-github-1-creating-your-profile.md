# Exercise 7 â€“ GitHub 1: Creating Your Profile

- Go to https://github.com and create an account
- Go to your repositories by clicking your avatar in the top right and going to Your repositories
- Press the shiny green New button
- To create a special repository for your profile, the repository name should be identical to your username, make sure it's set to public, and that "Add README" is checked (for coming repositories that aren't supposed to be your profile, the name can be anything)
- Create a Personal Access Token
  - Go to settings (click on your profile picture and select settings), and then to developer settings
  - Under Personal access tokens, select Fine-grained tokens
  - Press Generate a new token
  - Set a name for the token to remember what it is for, for example "Git in terminal"
  - Either keep the expiration date (the date when you need to renew the token for it to continue to work) or select a different expiration date (such as never).
  - Select that it should have access to all repositories
  - Under Permissions, press the Add permissions button and add "Contents" as a repository permission
  - Change the Contents access to "Read and write"
  - Save
  - Copy the token and store it in a safe place (I highly recommend using a password manager to manage passwords and tokens). Anyone that gets access to the token can access your repositories. As the text states on the page, you will not be able to see the token again (but can delete it).
- Navigate to the repository we created before (clicking your profile and selecting repositories and then clicking the repository)
- In the green Code dropdown, copy the HTTPS repository URL
- In your terminal, navigate to your home folder by typing only `cd` (or any other folder where you want the project to be)
- Type `git clone https://github.com/my-username/my-username.git` (make sure to replace the web adress with the one you just copied from github), this will create a folder and clone the repository from github into that folder
- Navigate to the folder in the terminal with the `cd my-username` command (replace with your username)
- Create a new branch called `dev` (a common name for branches for changes not yet finished) and checkout
- In VS Code, open the folder that was created by the clone command, and update the README.md with a short description of yourself. This file is a markdown file (.md) so you can use any markdown formatting to style your text.
  - If you want to add images to your profile readme, create a new folder in the same folder called images and add your images there. Then you can use relative paths to show the image according to the markdown image syntax: `![Description of image](images/my-image.jpg)`
- Save your file and commit the changes to the repository
- Push your local changes to the dev branch on the remote on github (called origin) with `git push origin dev`
  - You will be prompted to enter your username and Personal access token (not your login password)
- You should now see that it has been pushed to a new branch on github called `dev` . And on github, you should see your changes in the readme if you switch to the dev branch using the dropdown on the repository's Code page.
- Since this is your own private repository, you would normally just merge to main, or even commit directly on main. But as a learning exercise we will open a Pull request (PR)
- On your repository page, there should be a yellow banner that says "dev had recent pushes...", and a green "Compare & pull request" button. Press that.
  - If the banner doesn't show up, first make sure that you see your changes on github in the dev branch. And if so, go to the Pull requests tab and press the "New pull request" button there
- In the top of the Compare changes view, there will be two dropdowns specifying the target and the source branch. In our case they should be main and dev (with the arrow pointing at main).
- Below that you will see a list of commits made, and also all the code changes (the diff). The diff will look a bit more clean than the one we've previously looked at in the terminal.
- Go ahead and press Create pull request, enter a title and a description (optional) and press Create pull request again
- As said before, normally in this private profile repository you wouldn't ask for reviews, but when working together with other people on projects giving and receiving code reviews is an essential part of collaboration. Requesting reviews can only be done towards a user that is added as a collaborator to the project, but anyone with read access to the repository can give a un-requested review. We'll skip adding a collaborator and instead ask for a review by turning to a classmate and ask them to go to your profile repository and opening up the PR (use your learning pair for the course if available, otherwise organise so that everyone gives and receives one review).
- In addition to requesting a review from a classmate, you should also have gotten a request to review from a classmate yourself. So let's do that now.
- Go to the repository of your classmate either by entering the url manually, or searching for their username and going to their repositories, and the repository matching their username.
- Go to the Pull request tab and click on the open PR in the list
- Here you can read any description they have provided, look at the commits, and all changes
- Click the Files changed tab to see all changes
- In a normal code review, you might want to comment on a specific line that has changed. In that case you press the blue plus button that appears when you hover on the line you want to comment (it has to be a line that has changed) and add a comment to, or start, your review
- Press the green Review changes button in the top right
- Enter a comment, select Approve, and press Submit review
  - Here you could chose to only comment, or even request changes, but let's go ahead and approve the PR
- Tell your classmate that you've given them an approval
- Wait for your classmate to also approve your PR
- Back in your own repository, you should now see a checkmark in the timeline of the PR that your classmate reviewed and left an approval
- Press the Merge pull request button
- Enter a Commit message for your merge and a description. Best practice here is to have a descriptive title and additional information in the description, this makes it easy to follow the history of a project, to see when and why features were added.
- Press Confirm merge.
- If you are working on a temporary feature branch, it's often best practice to delete the branch afterwards. Usually only main and dev are branches that are long lived in projects. In this case, if you want to keep doing changes to the profile, and experiment without it being public directly on your profile page on github, let the dev branch live. Otherwise, go ahead and press Delete branch. You can always create a new branch called dev later.
- Go to your profile by pressing the avatar in the top right and pressing Your profile, your new profile text should now be visible on your profile page, congratulations!
