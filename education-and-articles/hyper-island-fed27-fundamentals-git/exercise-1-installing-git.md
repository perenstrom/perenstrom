# Exercise 1 – Installing Git

## Mac

- On mac, run `xcode-select --install` in your terminal to install xcode command line tools (and git)
- Go through the installer (this might take some time since it will download a bunch of stuff, feel free to continue with the terminal assignment in the meantime)
- Verify that it's installed by typing `git version`

## Windows

- Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads/win
- Open the downloaded installer
- Go through the installer, change the following options from default
  - TODO:
- Open Git for bash and type `git version` to verify
