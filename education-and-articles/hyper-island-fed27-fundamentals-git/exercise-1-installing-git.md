# Exercise 1 – Installing Git

In this exercise we will install Git on our computer. We do this before [Exercise 2 – Terminal](./exercise-2-terminal.md) for two reasons.

1. The installation on Mac can take some time and it's best to get the installation started.
1. Installing Git on Windows also installs a Terminal-like program called _Git Bash_ which we will use for the following exercises.

## Mac

- Open the program _Terminal_ (it's in the _Utilities_ in your Applications folder), type `xcode-select --install` and press enter to install xcode command line tools (and git)
- Go through the installer (this might take some time since it will download a bunch of stuff, feel free to continue with [Exercise 2 – Terminal](./exercise-2-terminal.md) in the meantime)
- Verify that it's installed by typing `git version` and pressing enter in your terminal

## Windows

- Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads/win
- Open the downloaded installer
- Go through the installer, change the following options from default
  - TODO:
- Open Git Bash and type `git version` and press enter to verify
