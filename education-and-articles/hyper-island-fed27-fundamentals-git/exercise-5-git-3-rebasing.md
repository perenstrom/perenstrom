# Exercise 5 â€“ Git 3: Rebasing

_[Relevant section from the talk](https://github.com/perenstrom/talks/blob/main/2025-09-05-hyper-island-git/2025-09-05-hyper-island-git-4.pdf)_

In this exercise we will learn how to Rebase a branch onto another branch. This is used to get the latest changes on `main` to our feature branch. Use the presentation PDF linked above as a reference for the commands you need and some terminology, also use the previous exercises for commands learned in those exercises.

1. Create a new branch and checkout with `git checkout -b my-feature-branch-3`
1. Do changes in the readme file and commit them, do another set of changes in the readme file and commit them as well
1. Checkout the main branch
1. Do some changes in the text2 file, and commit them
1. Checkout the my-feature-branch-3 branch
1. Your feature branch is now "behind", some changes has happened on the main branch that you would like on your branch as well. We could do a merge as the last exercise, where we merge main into our branch, instead we will do a rebase
1. Unlike merge, we want to have our feature branch checked out when we do the rebase, and specify which branch we want to rebase onto, so check out the feature branch
1. Do a rebase with `git rebase main`, which will take our two commits on `my-feature-branch-3`, and apply them one after the other on top of the latest changes on `main`
1. Now our feature branch is up to date with main, and we can continue our work, or merge to main
1. For this exercise, go ahead and checkout main, and merge your feature branch into main
